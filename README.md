# Salmon aquaculture elevates levels of Atlantic salmon eDNA, but not pathogen eDNA across First Nations’ territories
Analysis of eDNA data collected in Knight inlet and Clio channel, in the Broughton Archipelago, British Columbia, Canada in summer 2024.

Briefly, this study was conceptualized by Brad Puglas, an elected council member of the Mamalilikulla First Nation (MFN). The goal was to determine if the three remaining Atlantic salmon farms operating in the Broughton Archipelago---in an area of joint territorial claims by MFN and Tlowitsis First Nation (TFN)---were contributing elevated salmon pathogens levels to Knight Inlet (sole MFN territory). We predicted that if this were the case, we'd see elevated pathogen eDNA concentrations in the mouth of Clio Channel (nearer the salmon farms) than in Knight Inlet.

Seawater samples were collected and filtered on site at 24 sample locations (12 at the mouth of Clio Channel, and 12 in Knight Inlet). We used qPCR to quantify eDNA concentration for Atlantic salmon and six common salmon pathogens. We found that Atlantic salmon eDNA, but not pathogen eDNA, was elevated in Clio Channel compared to Knight Inlet. Atlantic salmon eDNA was detected more than 5 kms from the nearest source farm, indicating that some eDNA is able to disperse these distances into MFN territory.

The data and scripts here accompany the manuscript "Salmon aquaculture elevates levels of Atlantic salmon eDNA, but not pathogen eDNA across First Nations’ territories", submitted to the Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences in July 2025.
